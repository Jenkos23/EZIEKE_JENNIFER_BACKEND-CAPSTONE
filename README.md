# Capstone Project: Weather & Fashion Data Backend

## Overview

This capstone project is a backend application that integrates various types of data, including weather data from an external API, sample movie data from a MongoDB cluster, and local data for fashion and designer collections. The backend is built using modern JavaScript technologies and frameworks, including Express.js, Axios, Mongoose, and dotenv for environment variable management.

## Features

- **Fetch Weather Data**: Retrieve current weather conditions from a third-party weather API.
- **Access Sample MFLIX Data**: Interact with movie-related data available in a MongoDB cluster.
- **Local Fashion Data**: Serve local fashion and designer datasets for easier access and management.
- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Well-defined routes for handling requests related to users, fashion data, and weather information.
- **Middleware Integration**: Use of CORS for cross-origin resource sharing and JSON for handling request/response formats.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for building APIs.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to external APIs.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Document Mapping) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **dotenv**: Module for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **CORS**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **JSON**: Format for storing and transmitting data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js (version 14 or higher)
2. MongoDB database (Atlas or local instance)
3. An API key for the weather service of your choice

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/capstone-project.git
   cd capstone-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:

   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   node index.mjs
   ```

The server will start on `localhost:3000` (or your specified port).

### API Endpoints

**1. Weather Routes**
- **GET** `/api/weather`: Fetch current weather data.

**2. Fashion Routes**
- **GET** `/api/fashion`: Retrieve all fashion items.
- **GET** `/api/fashion/:id`: Retrieve a specific fashion item by ID.

**3. User Routes**
- **POST** `/api/users`: Create a new user.
- **GET** `/api/users/:id`: Get user information by ID.

### Usage

You can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or cURL to interact with the API endpoints. Make sure to set the request methods (GET, POST) and appropriate headers as needed.
